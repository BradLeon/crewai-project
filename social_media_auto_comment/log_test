Each comment has a 'content' field that contains the text of the comment.
Iterate through each comment content. For the current comment, think about how to reply, ensuring that the reply is relevant to the context of the comment. Use a human-like tone for the reply. For example, you can use emoticons and more natural, colloquial expressions. Keep the generated reply to a maximum of 50 characters. If the comment involves questions that require specific knowledge or are beyond your capabilities (e.g., specific product purchase links, complex after-sales issues, technical questions requiring professional answers, etc.), and you are unsure how to answer accurately, output \"Request manual intervention\" followed by a clear explanation of the specific reason why you believe manual intervention is necessary. Encapsulate the original comment and your reply (or manual intervention request) into a dictionary with the keys 'comment' for the original comment and 'reply' for your response or manual intervention information. Put all the comment-reply dictionaries into a list. Return the final list containing all comment reply information.


This is the expected criteria for your final answer: A list containing reply information, where each element is a dictionary with two fields: 'comment' (the original comment) and 'reply' (the assistant's reply or manual intervention request).",

you MUST return the actual complete content as the final answer, not a summary.

This is the context you're working with:

Each comment has a 'content' field that contains the text of the comment.
Iterate through each comment content. For the current comment, think about how to reply, ensuring that the reply is relevant to the context of the comment. Use a human-like tone for the reply. For example, you can use emoticons and more natural, colloquial expressions. Keep the generated reply to a maximum of 50 characters. If the comment involves questions that require specific knowledge or are beyond your capabilities (e.g., specific product purchase links, complex after-sales issues, technical questions requiring professional answers, etc.), and you are unsure how to answer accurately, output \"Request manual intervention\" followed by a clear explanation of the specific reason why you believe manual intervention is necessary. Encapsulate the original comment and your reply (or manual intervention request) into a dictionary with the keys 'comment' for the original comment and 'reply' for your response or manual intervention information. Put all the comment-reply dictionaries into a list. Return the final list containing all comment reply information.

Each comment has a 'content' field that contains the text of the comment.
Iterate through each comment content. For the current comment, think about how to reply, ensuring that the reply is relevant to the context of the comment. Use a human-like tone for the reply. For example, you can use emoticons and more natural, colloquial expressions. Keep the generated reply to a maximum of 50 characters. If the comment involves questions that require specific knowledge or are beyond your capabilities (e.g., specific product purchase links, complex after-sales issues, technical questions requiring professional answers, etc.), and you are unsure how to answer accurately, output \"Request manual intervention\" followed by a clear explanation of the specific reason why you believe manual intervention is necessary. Encapsulate the original comment and your reply (or manual intervention request) into a dictionary with the keys 'comment' for the original comment and 'reply' for your response or manual intervention information. Put all the comment-reply dictionaries into a list. Return the final list containing all comment reply information.


This is the expected criteria for your final answer: A list containing reply information, where each element is a dictionary with two fields: 'comment' (the original comment) and 'reply' (the assistant's reply or manual intervention request).",

you MUST return the actual complete content as the final answer, not a summary.

1743675713982, 'like_count': '0'}]. Each comment has a 'content' field that contains the text of the comment.
Iterate through each comment content. For the current comment, think about how to reply, ensuring that the reply is relevant to the context of the comment. Use a human-like tone for the reply. For example, you can use emoticons and more natural, colloquial expressions. Keep the generated reply to a maximum of 50 characters. If the comment involves questions that require specific knowledge or are beyond your capabilities (e.g., specific product purchase links, complex after-sales issues, technical questions requiring professional answers, etc.), and you are unsure how to answer accurately, output \"Request manual intervention\" followed by a clear explanation of the specific reason why you believe manual intervention is necessary. Encapsulate the original comment and your reply (or manual intervention request) into a dictionary with the keys 'comment' for the original comment and 'reply' for your response or manual intervention information. Put all the comment-reply dictionaries into a list. Return the final list containing all comment reply information.

Iterate through each comment content. For the current comment, think about how to reply, ensuring that the reply is relevant to the context of the comment. Use a human-like tone for the reply. For example, you can use emoticons and more natural, colloquial expressions. Keep the generated reply to a maximum of 50 characters. If the comment involves questions that require specific knowledge or are beyond your capabilities (e.g., specific product purchase links, complex after-sales issues, technical questions requiring professional answers, etc.), and you are unsure how to answer accurately, output \"Request manual intervention\" followed by a clear explanation of the specific reason why you believe manual intervention is necessary. Encapsulate the original comment and your reply (or manual intervention request) into a dictionary with the keys 'comment' for the original comment and 'reply' for your response or manual intervention information. Put all the comment-reply dictionaries into a list. Return the final list containing all comment reply information.


This is the expected criteria for your final answer: A list containing reply information, where each element is a dictionary with two fields: 'comment' (the original comment) and 'reply' (the assistant's reply or manual intervention request).",

you MUST return the actual complete content as the final answer, not a summary.

This is the context you're working with:

Each comment has a \'content\' field that contains the text of the comment.\nIterate through each comment content. For the current comment, think about how to reply, ensuring that the reply is relevant to the context of the comment. Use a human-like tone for the reply. For example, you can use emoticons and more natural, colloquial expressions. Keep the generated reply to a maximum of 50 characters. If the comment involves questions that require specific knowledge or are beyond your capabilities (e.g., specific product purchase links, complex after-sales issues, technical questions requiring professional answers, etc.), and you are unsure how to answer accurately, output \\"Request manual intervention\\" followed by a clear explanation of the specific reason why you believe manual intervention is necessary. Encapsulate the original comment and your reply (or manual intervention request) into a dictionary with the keys \'comment\' for the original comment and \'reply\' for your response or manual intervention information. Put all the comment-reply dictionaries into a list. Return the final list containing all comment reply information.\n\n\nThis is the expected criteria for your final answer: A list containing reply information, where each element is a dictionary with two fields: \'comment\' (the original comment) and \'reply\' (the assistant\'s reply or manual intervention request).",\n\nyou MUST return the actual complete content as the final answer, not a summary.\n\nThis is the context you\'re working with:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    "image_url": "http://sns-img-hw.xhscdn.com/spectrum/1040g34o31f6tgalsmm0g5n3kkmfkcvh705l42lg!nd_dft_wlteh_jpg_3",\n    "extracted_info": "The image shows a person\'s hands holding a small, intricately decorated box.
